How to showcase text message on screen using Cardboard App
===========
This project aims at developing inexpensive virtual reality (VR) text messages for everyone on a click of a trigger. The 3ds file which is a part of animation has played a major role as it is the image file which is been used. This project enables users to know about the use of VR Cardboard and its functioning. 

Notes- 
This epic work appeared due to several events. First, in the Android Emulator appeared support for hardware video acceleration, allowing full-rate work, not only the interface, but also test programs that use OpenGL ES 2.0. Second, approaching birthday beloved wife, and the best complement to a new smartphone or tablet will personally written program card for him. Said - done: create the outline of the project on android Tutorial'u , We reach the shelf old Direct3D-projects using file upload .3ds, render-to-texture and pack shaders rewritten in Java and OpenGL ES 2.0, we obtain that in the picture. Greeting text and the like add later. All the information on the use of OpenGL ES 2.0 for Android was highly fragmented, knowledge gathered bit by bit ... I hope this post will help those who in the future will face the same problems as me. And now more.
